Building the Radio Shack MIDI Lights project:

WARNING:  Using this project to control holiday lights involves working 
with High Voltage.  This can potentially hurt or kill you, burn you house down, 
that kind of thing.  If you are not experienced, capable, and comfortable 
working with 120VAC mains power, do not attempt this part of the project.  
Instead, use this project to control 12V lighting.


1. Acquire the parts, inspect the schematic,  and build the circuit board.  

You can use the board layout I have provided and order your board directly 
from ExpressPCB, you can design and etch your own PCB layout, or you can 
build it on a perfboard with point to point wiring.  

If you chose to have it made at Express PCB, try to team up with some other 
people to reduce your price - the minimum order is 2 board and the price per 
board goes down with quantity.

If you are going to build it on a perfboard, you should be able to fit 
everything on a Radio Shack p/n 276-147 if you keep it compact.  You can still
use my board layout as a guide for where to place the components.


2. Program the Arduino.  

Download the Arduino code from the github repository, compile it, and 
upload it onto your Arduino.  This project was built and testing using an 
Arduino Uno.


3. Connect the circuit board to the Arduino.

You can do this in any number of ways.  If you want the quickest and cheapest
approach, just run wires from the connection points on the circuit board and
plug them into the Arduino headers. 

The method I prefer is to use 0.1" headers on the circuit board and jumpers
with connections that will fit over those headers.


4. Test the setup.

Do this step BEFORE making any connections to the screw terminals on the relays.

Attach a MIDI keyboard and power up the board and the Arduino.  You should 
hear all of the relays click 3 times.  Put the mode switch in "Live" and verify
that the notes you are playing on the keyboard are being translated into 
relays turning on and off.  You can see which relays are active by the LEDs.


5. Connect the lights.

This step is entirely at your own discretion and risk.  If you are not 
experienced and 100% comfortable with high voltage, DO NOT attempt to connect
120VAC lighting to this project.  Use 12V lighting instead.

If you choose to use 120VAC lighting, the relays are configured to work as 
light switches through their associated terminal blocks.  Wire the lighting
accordingly.
