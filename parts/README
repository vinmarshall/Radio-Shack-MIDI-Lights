The files in this directory contain information on sourcing parts for this 
project.  

circuit_board_BOM - A chart correlating part numbers on the schematic and 
  PCB to actual parts.

ordering_BOM - A Bill of Materials for ordering parts for this project.


PCB:

The PCB can be sourced from ExpressPCB.  For a board this big, they're not 
exactly cheap, but they are quick.  You may want to team up with a few other 
people building this circuit, as the unit price quickly goes down with quantity.

Instructions - 
 - Download their software from http://www.expresspcb.com/ if you don't already 
   have it.
 - Open the ./PCB/rs_midi_lights.pcb file
 - From the 'Layout' menu, select "Compute Board Cost" to see your options 
   (Standard or Proto) and then "Order Boards via the Internet" to order.

I've also included PDFs of the top, bottom, and silkscreen layers as well as a 
mechanical drawing of the board and a picture of the component placement which 
should be useful if you are laying out your own PCB or doing point to point 
wiring.

If you are going to doing this with point to point wiring on a perf board, you 
should be able to get this all to fit on 2 of Radio Shack p/n 276-147 - one
board for the relays and one for everything else.


ENCLOSURE:

I haven't specified a specific enclosure for this project, but make sure you 
enclose it completely in something to protect it from contamination, foreign 
objects, hands, etc... - especially if you choose to run 120VAC on the power
busses.  They CANNOT be left exposed.


PARTS:

The ordering_BOM file lists the parts I used to build the circuit and their
sources.  If you don't decide to build the project exactly as I did, the list
should at least give you a head start on your own build.
