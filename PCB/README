The files in this directory pertain to the printed circuit board design.

Even if you don't choose to have your board professionally made, the mechanical
drawings, pictures of component placement, and the PDFs of the board layers
may help you in putting together your own board.  

I had my board made by ExpressPCB (great when you're in a hurry) and the board 
and schematic files here are in their program's format.

pcb_bottom_traces.pdf - The traces on the bottom side of the board.

pcb_components.bmp - How the components are laid out on top of the board.

pcb_dimensions.AD_DRW - Alibre CAD version of the pcb_dimensions.pdf 

pcb_dimensions.pdf - A mechanical drawing of the board with dimensions.

pcb_mechanical.dxf - DXF (2-D CAD) mechanical drawing of the board.

pcb_silkscreen.pdf - The silkscreen layer on top of the board.

pcb_top_traces.pdf - The traces on the top side of the board.

./PCBComponents_Custom - Custom components from this board for the ExpressPCB 
  software.

rs_midi_lights.pcb - ExpressPCB file with the board.

rs_midi_lights.sch - ExpressPCB file with the schematic.

./SchComponents_Custom - Custom components from this circuit for the ExpressPCB 
  software.

./SchSymbols_Custom - Custom symbols from this cicuit for the ExpressPCB software.
